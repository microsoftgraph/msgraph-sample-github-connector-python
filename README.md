# Microsoft Graph Python GitHub connector sample

![License.](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg)

Microsoft Graph connectors let you add your own data to the semantic search index and have it power various Microsoft 365 experiences. This TypeScript application shows you how to use the [Microsoft Graph connector](https://learn.microsoft.com/graph/connecting-external-content-connectors-overview) API to create a custom connector that indexes issues and repositories from GitHub. This connector sample powers experiences such as Microsoft Search, Copilot in Teams, the Microsoft 365 App, and more.

## Experiences

The Microsoft Graph connector experiences that will be enabled in the sample include:

- [Microsoft Search](https://learn.microsoft.com/graph/connecting-external-content-experiences#microsoft-search)
- [Context IQ in Outlook on the web](https://learn.microsoft.com/graph/connecting-external-content-experiences#context-iq-in-outlook-on-the-web-preview)
- [Microsoft 365 Copilot](https://learn.microsoft.com/graph/connecting-external-content-experiences#microsoft-365-copilot-limited-preview)
- [Microsoft 365 app: Quick Access & My Content](https://learn.microsoft.com/graph/connecting-external-content-experiences#microsoft-365-app)
- Type Down Suggestions (Query formulation)
- Simplified admin experience in the Teams admin center (Microsoft 356 App)

## Prerequisites
- Install [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)
- A Microsoft work or school account with the Global administrator role. If you don't have a Microsoft account, you can [sign up for the Microsoft 365 Developer Program](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/dev-program) to get a free Microsoft 365 subscription
- A [GitHub account](https://github.com)
- Enable the [simplified admin experience in the Teams admin center](https://learn.microsoft.com/graph/connecting-external-content-deploy-teams)
